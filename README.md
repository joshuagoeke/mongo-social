# UTA Bootcamp Challenge 18

In this homework assignment from the University of Texas-Austin Bootcamp we were asked to set up the back-end of a MongoDB database for use with a theoretical social media site. Which led to...

## Description

Mongo-Social is a joke social media platform that provides a slightly humorous exploration of the back-end of a very simple social network application utilizing Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. 

Completing this challenge helped me learn quite a bit about connecting all of the endpoints to a no-SQL database utilizing the Mongoose ODM to make sure that only clean data that fits a schema goes in and out of the database. I began by re-factoring code provided by the University of Texas-Austin Bootcamp, but then found myself chucking sections of it to re-write based on the advice and examples porvided by more experienced peers and mentors.

I definitely learned a lot about routes with MongoDB!

## Installation

If you want to run this on your local machine, you can install MongoDB, just be sure to adjust your connection string in the configuration javascript file!

You will also need Insomnia to test the various routes and request bodies.

## Usage

Here's a video that shows how this program works without a front-end!
